# Classical Machine Learning

This repository will collate the many classical machine learning techniques that I have been introduced to over the years. Many of these techniques are interpretable (i.e. white-box models) and can often provide valuable insights in business, sciences, etc. Many of these techniques also have statistic foundations.
