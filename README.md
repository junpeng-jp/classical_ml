# Classical Machine Learning
------

This repository will collate the many classical machine learning techniques that I have been introduced to over the years. Many of these techniques are interpretable (i.e. white-box models) and can often provide valuable insights in business, sciences, etc. Many of these techniques also have statistic foundations.


# Repository Structure
The machine learning notebooks will be group as follows:
 - 1_regression
 - 2_classification
 - 3_clustering
 - 4_time_series
 - 5_boosting
