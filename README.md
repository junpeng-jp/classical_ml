# Classical Machine Learning

This repository will collate the many classical machine learning techniques that I have been introduced to over the years. Many of these techniques are interpretable (i.e. white-box models) and can often provide valuable insights in business, sciences, etc. Many of these techniques also have statistic foundations.

# Repository Structure

The machine learning notebooks will be group as follows:
 - 1_regression
 - 2_clustering
 - 3_margin_classifier
 - 4_decision_trees
 - 5_time_series
 - 6_ensembling
